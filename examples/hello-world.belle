Why! cried Alice,
The white rabbit stopped, stared, startled,
A rabbit carrying a clock, that I had never seen!
The rabbit took his pocket watch,
Looked at it for a moment,
It is getting late, I must make haste,
He sprung forth and entered a small hole in a tree,
My! And it gets curiouser still!
Left alone, Alice wondered,
Would she get his attention by starting with a "Hello?"
